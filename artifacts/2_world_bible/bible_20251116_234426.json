Suddenly, a menacing dog appears, and dark thunderclouds gather overhead, casting a shadow of fear. Just as the threat feels overwhelming, the teddy bear magically comes to life, standing bravely between the girl and the dog. It radiates a warm, gentle glow that intensifies into a powerful beam shooting upward, dispersing the dark clouds above. Startled by the bear’s courage and the clearing skies, the dog runs away in fear. Relieved, the girl stands back up and hugs her teddy bear tightly. The scene then transitions to the cozy safety of her bedroom, where she holds her steadfast companion close, feeling comforted and protected.",
