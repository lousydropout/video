  "script": "Bathed in warm sunlight, a little girl walks through a vibrant park, clutching her teddy bear close. Suddenly, a fierce dog appears, growling sharply. She stumbles back in fear and falls. Then, the teddy bear springs to life, standing tall and fearless. Its soft paws ward off the dog, which retreats. The girl is safe, her heart full of gratitude. Later, she sits quietly on her bedroom floor, the teddy bear in her arms and a small toy dog forgotten beside her. Sometimes, the bravest protectors live in our imagination, always there to comfort.",
