  "critique": "The script delivers a clear and emotionally engaging narrative that fits well within the brief timeframe. The progression from innocence to fear, then relief, creates a satisfying emotional arc. The pacing feels balanced, allowing key moments—the threat, the bear’s transformation, and the girl’s comfort—to resonate without feeling rushed. Product integration is natural and central, highlighting the teddy bear as both protector and source of comfort. Character behavior remains consistent, with the girl’s vulnerability and the bear’s protective role clearly defined. The theme of safety and companionship comes through strongly and cohesively. Overall, the script is well-suited to its concise format and effectively communicates its message.",
