  "script": "A little girl strolls happily through a sunlit park, clutching her teddy bear, until a menacing dog suddenly appears, causing her to step back in fear beneath gathering dark clouds and distant thunder. Just when the threat feels overwhelming, her teddy bear comes to life, standing bravely between her and the danger, radiating a warm, gentle light that softly chases the fear away and restores calm. Relieved, the girl hugs her bear tightly, and later, safe in her cozy room, she holds it close, feeling comforted and protected by her steadfast companion.",
