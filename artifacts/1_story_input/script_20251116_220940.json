  "script": "A little girl walks happily through a sunlit park, clutching her teddy bear, when suddenly a menacing dog appears, causing her to step back in fear. Though dark clouds and distant thunder loom in the background, it is the dog that frightens her most. Then, her teddy bear comes to life, standing bravely between her and the threat, a warm light radiating from it that gently chases the danger away and restores calm. The girl hugs her bear tightly, relief washing over her, and later, safe in her cozy room, she holds the teddy bear close, comforted and protected.",
