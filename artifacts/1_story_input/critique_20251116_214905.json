  "critique": "The script’s narrative is clear and emotionally engaging, effectively conveying a protective and comforting theme. The emotional arc—from fear to safety and gratitude—is well established, creating a satisfying resolution. The pacing feels a bit tight for the story’s beats; the transition from danger to safety and then to quiet reflection might benefit from slightly more breathing room to enhance emotional impact. Product integration is subtle and natural, with the teddy bear as the central protective figure. Character consistency is strong, with the girl’s vulnerability and the bear’s bravery clearly portrayed. The theme of imagination as a source of comfort comes through clearly. To better suit the brief and your feedback, consider simplifying sentence structure and using shorter sentences to improve clarity and impact within the limited timeframe.",
