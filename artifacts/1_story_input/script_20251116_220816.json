  "script": "Bathed in golden sunlight, a little girl strolls joyfully through a vibrant park, clutching her beloved teddy bear close, her laughter mingling with the gentle breeze; suddenly, the sky darkens as ominous clouds gather and a menacing dog emerges, its low growl sending a shiver through the air, while thunder rumbles and lightning flashes, mirroring the girl’s fear as she stumbles back; then, in a tender moment of magic, the teddy bear springs to life, stepping bravely between her and the threat, a warm, radiant light piercing the storm to chase the danger away, restoring calm and sunshine; the girl’s relief blooms into a heartfelt embrace, and the scene softly shifts to her cozy bedroom where she sits on the floor, still holding the teddy bear tightly, a toy dog lying forgotten nearby—revealing the park encounter was a vivid dream—while the words appear gently on screen: “Teddy bear, always there to comfort.”",
