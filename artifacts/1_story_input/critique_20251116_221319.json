  "critique": "The narrative is clear and emotionally engaging, effectively conveying a moment of fear transformed into comfort. The emotional arc moves smoothly from innocence to tension, then relief, and finally warmth, which suits the brief timeframe well. Pacing feels tight but appropriate, allowing key moments to land without feeling rushed. The product—the teddy bear—is integrated naturally as both a source of comfort and heroism, reinforcing its protective qualities. Character consistency is maintained, with the girl’s vulnerability and the bear’s bravery clearly portrayed. Thematic clarity around courage and companionship shines through. Including the dog’s reaction as running away enhances the resolution and strengthens the emotional payoff. Overall, the script works well within the constraints and delivers a compelling, concise story.",
