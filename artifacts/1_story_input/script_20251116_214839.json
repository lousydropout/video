  "script": "Bathed in warm sunlight, a little girl strolls through a vibrant park, clutching her beloved teddy bear close, her eyes wide with innocent wonder; suddenly, a fierce dog emerges, its growl sharp and threatening, causing her to stumble backward in fear and fall on her bottom, but in a magical twist, the teddy bear springs to life, standing tall and fearless, its soft paws warding off danger as the dog retreats, leaving the girl safe and her heart swelling with gratitude—then the scene gently shifts to reveal her sitting quietly on her bedroom floor, the teddy bear nestled in her arms, a small toy dog lying forgotten beside her, reminding us that sometimes, the bravest protectors live in our imagination, always there to comfort.",
