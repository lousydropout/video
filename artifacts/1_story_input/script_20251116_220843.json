  "script": "Bathed in golden sunlight, a little girl walks happily through a bright park, clutching her teddy bear. Suddenly, dark clouds gather, and a growling dog appears, making her step back in fear. Thunder rumbles as lightning flashes, matching her fright. Then, the teddy bear comes to life, standing bravely between her and the threat. A warm light shines, chasing the danger away and bringing back calm. The girl hugs her bear tightly, relief washing over her. Later, she sits in her cozy room, still holding the teddy bear, a toy dog forgotten nearby. The words appear: “Teddy bear, always there to comfort.”",
