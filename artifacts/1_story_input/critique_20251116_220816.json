  "critique": "The script presents a clear and emotionally engaging narrative with a strong thematic focus on comfort and protection. The emotional arc—from joy to fear, then relief—is well defined and resonates effectively. However, the pacing feels quite dense for the time frame, with multiple shifts in setting and mood that may challenge viewer absorption. Simplifying or streamlining some transitions could enhance clarity and maintain emotional impact. Product integration is subtle and meaningful, centering on the teddy bear as a comforting presence, which aligns well with the theme. Character consistency is solid, with the girl’s innocence and vulnerability clearly portrayed. Overall, tightening the flow will help ensure the story lands powerfully within the brief duration.",
