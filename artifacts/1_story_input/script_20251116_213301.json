  "script": "A little girl wanders through a sunlit park, cradling her teddy bear close, its soft fur a shield against the world. Suddenly, a growl pierces the air\u2014a fierce dog approaches, threatening her peace. But in a heartbeat, the teddy bear springs to life, standing tall and brave, its gentle strength driving the danger away. The girl\u2019s eyes fill with relief as they embrace, a bond unshaken by fear. The warmth of the moment dissolves as the scene gently shifts to a quiet bedroom, where the girl sits on the floor, clutching her teddy bear tightly, a fallen toy dog lying forgotten beside her. The magic lingers\u2014not in the world outside, but in the fearless comfort that only a teddy bear can offer. The screen fades to soft text: \u201cTeddy bear, always there to comfort.\u201d"
