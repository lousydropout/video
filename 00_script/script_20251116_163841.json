  "script": "In a sunlit park, a little girl clutches her teddy bear tightly, her steps light but cautious. Suddenly, a threatening dog appears, its growl fierce and unsettling. But then, as if touched by magic, her teddy bear springs to life\u2014standing tall and brave, shielding her with gentle strength until the dog retreats. The girl\u2019s face brightens with relief and love as she embraces her brave companion. The scene softens and shifts, revealing her safe in her bedroom, sitting on the floor with her teddy bear hugged close and a small toy dog lying still beside her. In that quiet moment, it\u2019s clear the teddy bear\u2019s courage was always real\u2014in her heart, always there to comfort."
