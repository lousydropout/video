  "script": "A little girl strolls through a sunlit park, hugging her teddy bear tightly, the warmth of the afternoon wrapping around them like a gentle embrace. Suddenly, a dog appears, barking sharply and closing in, and fear flickers in the girl\u2019s eyes. As her heart races, the teddy bear seems to grow braver\u2014standing tall and steadfast, a guardian born from her imagination. The fierce courage radiates from the bear, filling the girl with hope and strength. The dog halts and slowly retreats, its threat dissolving into calm. The girl wraps her arms around her protector, their bond a silent promise of comfort and safety. The world softens, and the scene gently shifts, revealing her safe on her bedroom floor, still holding her teddy bear close, a small toy dog resting nearby\u2014a quiet reminder of the adventure they just shared inside her mind. On screen, the words appear: \u201cTeddy bear, always there to comfort.\u201d"
