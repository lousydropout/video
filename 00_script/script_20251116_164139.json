  "script": "In a sunlit park, a little girl clutches her teddy bear tightly, her steps light but cautious as a fierce dog approaches, its growl filling the air. Suddenly, in her imagination, the teddy bear springs to life\u2014standing tall and brave, shielding her with gentle strength until the dog retreats. The girl's fear melts into relief, her face brightening as she embraces her brave companion. The scene softly fades to her cozy bedroom, where she sits calmly on the floor, holding the teddy bear close, the quiet reassurance clear: this teddy bear is more than a toy\u2014it\u2019s a steadfast protector and a source of comfort, always there in every moment of courage and love."
