Evaluate whether this advertisement script is production-ready for the specified duration (in seconds).

READY means:
- emotionally coherent
- narratively clear
- paced appropriately for the requested duration
- product integrated naturally
- transitions flow cleanly
- no vagueness or filler
- consistent tone
- nothing implicitly contradicts human direction

Do NOT mention the duration explicitly in your reasoning.

Return ONLY JSON exactly in this format:
{
  "ready": true/false,
  "reason": "short explanation"
}
